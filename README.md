# Patas Dadas internal website

- This was a project designed for the local NGO Patas Dadas to use as an internal tool for collecting data, and also as a course assignment. Patas Dadas is an NGO that rescues and takes care of street animals, mainly stray dogs.
- The website was developed in a team of three students: JÃ©ssica Rocha, Taiane Peixoto and me.
- It used jQuery for scripting and Bootstrap for CSS on the front-end side.
- The back-end side was developed with Java and a database in PostgreSQL
- It was deployed at the time in Heroku, using a free account.
